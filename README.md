# Liars-Dice
This is a multiplayer game of Liar's Dice built on a Node/Express server using Socket.io. It is my first full Node application.

## The Game
Liar's Dice is a simple bluffing game. Players wager how many of a dice face are on a table based on their own dice and the wagers of other players. A detailed explanation of the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_dice).

I have deployed this app to [liarsdiceonline.com](liarsdiceonline.com), feel free to give it a go. It is a multiplayer game, so be ready to either play with someone else or run it in two tabs.

## Building
To run locally: 
1. Install both Node and npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). 
2. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` in the commandline. This will install all of the dependencies needed for the project. 
3. Run the command `node server.js`. 
4. You should be able to find the site running on `localhost:8080` in your web browser.
